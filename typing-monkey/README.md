# Infinite Monkey Theorem

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

Here goes my implementation!

## Usage

```python

>>> import monkey
>>> monkey.score('python', repeat=10000)
('ykthon', 4)
```
